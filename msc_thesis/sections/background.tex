\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}

In this chapter, we begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the CUDA programming model and GPU microarchitecture, 
ensuring that readers have a solid understanding of the key concepts and components that define the CUDA 
ecosystem. Next, we introduce the MWP-CWP analytical model, which sheds light on the parallelism exhibited 
by Memory Warp Parallelism (MWP) and Computation Warp Parallelism (CWP) in GPU architectures. This model 
plays a critical role in analyzing and optimizing the performance of CUDA kernels. Through a clear explanation 
of these fundamental concepts, this chapter sets the stage for a deeper exploration of KLARAPTOR and its application 
in enhancing the performance of CUDA programs.
