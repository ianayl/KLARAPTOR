In this thesis, we present KLARAPTOR (Kernel LAunch parameters RAtional Program estimaTOR), 
a freely available tool to dynamically determine the values of kernel launch parameters of a {\cuda} kernel.
We describe a technique for building a helper program, at the compile-time of a {\cuda} program, 
that is used at run-time to determine near-optimal kernel launch parameters for the kernels of that {\cuda} program.
This technique leverages the MWP-CWP performance prediction model, runtime data parameters, and runtime 
hardware parameters to dynamically determine the launch parameters for each kernel invocation. 
This technique is implemented within the KLARAPTOR tool, utilizing the LLVM Pass Framework 
and NVIDIA Nsight Compute CLI profiler. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experimentation 
on the PolyBench benchmark suite of {\cuda} kernels.
