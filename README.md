* KLARAPTOR is a compile-time tool for CUDA programs which constructs and
  evaluates a rational program encoding the MWP-CWP performance model to 
  optimize the programâ€™s performance. The tool dynamically chooses kernel
  launch parameters (thread block configurations) which optimize its performance
  for data and hardware parameters of CUDA kernels.

* KLARAPTOR is built in the C programming language making use of (1) NVIDIA
  Nsight Compute CLI (ncu) to measure low-level metrics, (2) LAPACK for linear algebra, (3)
  BPAS (Basic Polynomial Algebra Subprograms) for efficient rational functions,
  and (4) LLVM Pass Framework to connect the constructed rational program and
  the CUDA program.

* NVIDIA cuda 11.7 or later must be already intalled, also, variable CUDA_PATH
  should be part of your ~/.bashrc.  

* KLARAPTOR has only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 for NVIDIA GPUs of the 
  following compute capability:
  * 7.5

* After installation, you might need to reload nvidia modules. The easiest way
  is to reboot.
